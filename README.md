# phrasal-template-game

A phrasal template game in the style of "MadLibs." 

I am a beginner to JavaScript, currently working through free resources such as The Odin Project, JavaScript.info and MDN Docs, and I wanted a somewhat simple project to learn from, that I could share with family and friends when I finished. JS Libs occured to me as a project that I could implement with my limited knowledge, while still having to research new methods as I went along. The project also allowed me to get some more practice in HTML and CSS.
