Once upon a time, a _adjective1_ _profession_ was 

_verbEndingInIng_ through the woods when he encountered a _container_. It was _adjective2_ and _shape_ and he was surprised to see such a _adjective3_ object out there in the woods. He peeked inside and saw it contained a _smallAnimal_. 
"Hello, _smallAnimal_," the _profession_ said. 
To his suprise, the _smallAnimal_ responded. "Hello, friend! Would you be so kind as to carry me and my _container_ to the next town? I am too _adjective4_ to carry this _container_ myself." 
The _profession_ obliged, and together he and the _smallAnimal_ journeyed on.
